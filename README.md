Simple program to help me insert colors and fonts I often use into my projects quicker.

By clicking on any color, the hex value of the color is copied to the clipboard. By clicking on a font, the Google Fonts CSS import statement is copied to the clipboard. 
The copied elements can be pasted into CSS sheets right away.
